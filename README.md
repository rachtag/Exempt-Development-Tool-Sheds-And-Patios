## How to Contribute Using Git (with VS Code)

We‚Äôll all use **VS Code** for development and Git integration.  
This workflow keeps our `main` branch clean and avoids conflicts.  

---

### Step 1. Clone the repository
1. Open **VS Code**.  
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) ‚Üí type **Git: Clone**.  
3. Paste the repository URL (https://github.com/rachtag/Exempt-Development-Tool-Sheds-And-Patios.git) and choose a folder on your computer.  
4. When prompted, open the project in VS Code.  

üëå You now have a local copy of the project.  

---

### Step 2. Create a new branch
1. In the **bottom-left corner** of VS Code, click the branch name (`main`).  
2. Select **+ Create new branch**.  
3. Name it something descriptive, like:  
   - `feature/add-valida

### Step 2. Create a new branch
1. In the **bottom-left corner** of VS Code, click the branch name (`main`).  
2. Select **+ Create new branch**.  
3. Name it something descriptive, like:  
   - `feature/add-validation`  
   - `fix/button-styling`  

üëâ This ensures your work is separate from `main`.  

---

### Step 3. Make code changes
1. Open files in VS Code and make your changes.  
2. When ready to save progress:  
   - Go to the **Source Control panel** (left sidebar, Branch icon).  
   - Stage changes by clicking the **+** next to the files.  
   - Enter a commit message (short description).  
   - Click the **‚úì Commit** button.  

OR use the terminal:  
```bash
git add . # Stage all changed files to be included in the next commit
git commit -m "Brief description of changes" # Create a new commit with a message describing your changes
```

---

### Step 4. Publish your branch to GitHub

1. In the bottom-right, VS Code will show Publish Branch ‚Üí click it.
This pushes your branch to GitHub.

Alternatively, from the terminal:
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name # Upload your local branch to GitHub (remote named 'origin')
```

---

### Step 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)

1. After pushing, VS Code will show a notification with Create Pull Request.
2. Click it ‚Üí GitHub will open in your browser.
3. Fill in the PR description (what, why, how).
4. Submit the PR to merge your branch into main.

---

### Step 6. Get approval and merge
1. A teammate must review and approve your PR on GitHub.
2. Once approved, the PR can be merged.
3. GitHub rules prevent direct commits to main.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes for Contributors ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **_DO NOT_** commit directly to main ‚Äì always create a **branch**.
- **Before starting new work, sync with main:**
    In VS Code, switch to main.
    Click Sync Changes (or run):
    ```bash
    git checkout main  # switch to the main branch
    git pull origin main # update it with the latest changes from GitHub
    ```
- **Keep commit messages clear and concise.**
- **If your branch gets out of date with main, run:**
    ```bash
    git fetch origin # Check GitHub (origin) for new commits
    git merge origin/main # Apply those commits to your current local branch
    ```
